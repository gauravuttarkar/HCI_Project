<stong>About the project</strong><br/>
Here we have built a book shelf with RFID tags. Whenever a book with an RFID reader in kept in each shelf, it will be read and updated in the database in realtime.<br/>
An Augmented reality application is built which will read the information about the books and shows it to the user<br/>
